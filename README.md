# BullCowGame
This is my first 3D game. I'm trying to learn C++ using Unreal Engine 4.

The objective of this game is to guess a hidden word.
The hidden word is an Isogram. If you guess wrong, you get 1 Bull per letter which is correct, and in the right place. You also get 1 Cow for each letter that's correct, but in the wrong position (Not counting the Bull letters).
The isograms are pulled from a file.


Developed with Unreal Engine 4
